# Chi_AQ
Use this repository to plot Chicago air quality using model and satellite data.
Still in development, for sure. Options to customize plotting is still in chi_map_cropped.py

Output of chi_map_cropped.py looks like this (with some minor adjustments in photoshop):
![Image of Chicago Air Quality given shapefile](https://github.com/stacymonty/Chi_AQ/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-06%20at%205.25.15%20PM.png)

The outside line crops image of the gridded data to the merged chicago shapefile.
Doesn't actually crop the data to the shapefile -- future work.
